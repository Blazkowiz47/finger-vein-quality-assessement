# Introduction

MMCBNU_6000 consists of finger vein images from 100 volunteers. Each subject was asked to provide images of his or her index finger, middle finger, and ring finger of both hands
in a conventional office environment (rather than a darkroom). The collection for each of the 6 fingers is repeated 10 times to obtain 60 finger vein images for each volunteer. Hence, MMCBNU_6000 is composed of
6,000 images. Each image is stored in “bmp” format with a resolution of 480×640.

1) The age of volunteers in MMCBNU_6000 varies from 16 to 72 years old.
2) The numbers of persons with blood types A, B, AB, and O are 32, 19, 11, and 28, respectively, while 10 volunteers did not know their blood types.
3) There are 83 males and 17 females in the 100 volunteers.
4) The volunteers participated in MMCBNU_6000 are from 20 countries. These countries cover Asian, Europe, Africa, and America.
